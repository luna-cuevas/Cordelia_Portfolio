# Cordelia_Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to build a robust portfolio for Cordelia, one of my friends and first client.
She requested that the website feature 80s themes like bubbly text, strong pastel colors, and an emphasis on video content. The first iteration of the website did not feature a lot of movement and would be best described as barebones. But with some css styling and a bit of bootstrap, the website began to take shape. 

The biggest hurdles that were presented were finding a way to ensure the website looked just as good on mobile as it does on a bigger screen. Media queries were heavily used along with flexbox and grid layouts.

After about a week of wrangling with finding out the best way to give the video content some movement, I found a few JS libraries that would allow a used to play video content by hovering over. I also managed to use one of w3s image slider concepts to have the videos auto cycle like a slideshow. 

Overall, the project still needs some code refactoring which is what I'm working on now. 

Things I aim to change:
	- Though the media queries do help maintain the responsiveness of the website, I feel like I can use vh and vw units to rely less on queries and cut down on css 		bloat.
	- I should definitely ensure that there are two versions of the pages so that the web version looks more like an image gallery.
	- Maybe instead of using smaller js libraries, I think I'll use gsap instead to ensure future functions.
	- I need to ensure accesibility features are added!
	
This being my first project, I learned a whole lot about css responsiveness, and JS libraries.
